        <p>
            City-state, former British colony. It is located on the islands separated from Malacca by the Strait of Johor. It shares borders with the Sultanate of Johor (Malaysia) and the Riau Islands (Indonesia).
        </p>
        <p>
        The city is spoken in <em>four languages</em>: Chinese, Malay, Tamil and English, which unites the multi-ethnic population of Singapore.
        </p>
        <p>
            Singapore has been described as a playground for the rich, and it's true that the small city-state does have a certain sheen of wealth. But Singapore offers more than just high-end shopping malls, luxury hotels, and fine dining (though it's worth indulging in those a bit if you can). There is also a vibrant history and diverse ethnic quarters to discover, along with many family-friendly attractions and lovely public spaces that make exploring this slightly futuristic city worthwhile.
